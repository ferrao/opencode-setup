# Project Management Methodologies

A reference of common project management methodologies.
For each methodology: What it is, when to use it, key pros/cons.
Use this to select the appropriate methodology for your project based on team size, complexity, and delivery needs.

---

### 1) Agile
- **What:** An iterative and incremental approach to project management that emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and small, rapid releases. Not a specific methodology but a set of principles and values.
- **Use when:** Requirements are evolving or uncertain; customer collaboration is critical; team needs to adapt quickly to change; rapid delivery is prioritized over comprehensive planning.
- **Pros:** Flexibility and adaptability; early and frequent delivery; customer satisfaction through continuous feedback; reduced risk of delivering wrong product.
- **Cons:** Less predictability in timeline and scope; requires active customer involvement; can lead to scope creep if not managed well; documentation may be lighter.

### 2) Waterfall
- **What:** A linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. Emphasizes thorough planning and documentation upfront.
- **Use when:** Requirements are well-defined and stable; clear project scope from start; compliance or regulated environments; projects with significant dependencies and rigid timelines.
- **Pros:** Clear milestones and deliverables; predictable timeline and budget; thorough documentation; easy to manage and track progress.
- **Cons:** Inflexible to changes; testing happens late in process; higher risk of delivering wrong product; can be slow to respond to feedback.

### 3) Scrum
- **What:** An Agile framework that organizes work into fixed-length iterations called sprints (typically 1-2 weeks). Includes specific roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team), ceremonies (daily standup, sprint planning, review, retrospective), and artifacts (product backlog, sprint backlog, increment).
- **Use when:** Product development with evolving requirements; teams need regular feedback cycles; projects benefit from structured process within Agile; medium to large teams with clear roles.
- **Pros:** Structured Agile approach with clear framework; frequent delivery of working product; transparency and visibility into progress; team empowerment and self-organization.
- **Cons:** Can be rigid in ceremony requirements; requires trained Scrum Master and buy-in from team; may be overkill for small/simple projects; scope changes are limited during sprint.

### 4) Kanban
- **What:** A visual method for managing work, limiting work-in-progress (WIP), and optimizing flow. Uses boards with columns representing workflow stages. Focuses on continuous delivery and improvement rather than fixed iterations.
- **Use when:** Continuous delivery is needed; team handles support/maintenance work alongside development; workflow is complex with variable task types; team wants to improve flow and reduce bottlenecks.
- **Pros:** Visual workflow management; flexible to changing priorities; focus on finishing work rather than starting new work; helps identify and resolve bottlenecks.
- **Cons:** Less structured than Scrum; requires discipline to enforce WIP limits; can lack timeboxing leading to tasks dragging; may not provide clear milestones for stakeholders.

## Selection Criteria

When choosing a methodology, consider:

- **Project Clarity**: Are requirements well-defined (Waterfall) or evolving (Agile)?
- **Team Structure**: Small/medium team (Kanban, Scrum) or large enterprise (Waterfall with Agile elements)?
- **Customer Involvement**: Can customer provide frequent feedback (Agile, Scrum) or prefer minimal interaction (Waterfall)?
- **Risk Tolerance**: Need flexibility and adaptation (Agile) or predictability and control (Waterfall)?
- **Delivery Cadence**: Continuous flow (Kanban) or fixed iterations (Scrum)?
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Need comprehensive documentation (Waterfall) or can work with lighter docs (Agile)?

## Hybrid Approaches

Many teams combine methodologies:

- **Scrum-ban**: Scrum framework with Kanban principles (WIP limits, visual boards)
- **Water-scrum-fall**: Waterfall planning, Agile execution, Waterfall delivery
- **Agile with Waterfall components**: Use Agile for development but Waterfall for compliance, testing, or deployment phases

## Methodology by Project Type

- **Software/Product Development**: Scrum, Kanban, Agile
- **Infrastructure/Operations**: Kanban, Waterfall
- **Regulated Industries**: Waterfall, or Agile with compliance overlays
- **Consulting/Services**: Agile, Scrum with customer involvement
- **Research/Exploration**: Agile, Kanban with loose structure
- **Maintenance/Support**: Kanban

## Common Patterns

- **Start simple**: Begin with basic Agile or Scrum, add complexity only as needed
- **Match team culture**: Choose methodology that fits team's working style and experience
- **Consider client**: Methodology must align with client's expectations and ability to participate
- **Plan for evolution**: Start with one methodology but be prepared to adapt as project and team mature
