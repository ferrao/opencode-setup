# Open Questions

A reusable set of guiding questions to surface gaps, clarify requirements, 
and ensure critical aspects of a system or idea are not overlooked. 

---

## 1. Problem Understanding
- What problem are we solving, and for whom?
- Why is this problem important now?
- What existing alternatives or workarounds exist?
- How do we know this problem is real (evidence, metrics, complaints)?
- What happens if we do nothing?

---

## 2. Goals & Success Criteria
- What does success look like from the user’s perspective?
- What measurable outcomes define success (KPIs, metrics)?
- Are there non-goals (explicitly out of scope)?
- Who defines success, and who validates it?

---

## 3. Stakeholders & Users
- Who are the primary users?
- Who are secondary or indirect users?
- Who are internal stakeholders (sponsors, reviewers, maintainers)?
- What conflicting interests might exist among stakeholders?

---

## 4. Assumptions & Dependencies
- What assumptions are we making about users, technology, or processes?
- How can we test or validate these assumptions early?
- What dependencies exist (internal teams, external services, regulations)?
- What happens if a dependency fails?

---

## 5. Solution Space
- What solution patterns or architectures are most relevant here?
- What trade-offs must we consider (cost vs. performance, speed vs. safety)?
- How simple can the solution be while still solving the problem?
- What alternatives should we explicitly rule out?

---

## 6. Risks & Uncertainties
- What are the top risks (technical, business, compliance, adoption)?
- What’s the worst-case scenario if the system fails?
- What unknowns need research before committing?
- What mitigations or fallback strategies exist?

---

## 7. Data & Information
- What data do we need, and where does it come from?
- What data must never be lost or corrupted?
- How is sensitive or personal data handled?
- What regulations affect data collection, storage, or sharing?

---

## 8. Architecture & Technology
- Which core components are required (API, DB, UI, infra)?
- What technologies are we considering, and why?
- What constraints exist (legacy systems, licensing, cloud vendor)?
- How will the system scale and evolve?

---

## 9. Process & Operations
- How will the system be developed (agile, waterfall, hybrid)?
- How will we test, deploy, and monitor it?
- Who will operate and maintain it long-term?
- What’s the plan for incident response and recovery?

---

## 10. Ethics & Trust
- Who could be harmed by this solution, directly or indirectly?
- How do we handle bias, fairness, or explainability?
- What privacy expectations must be met?
- How do we ensure transparency and accountability?

---

## 11. Open Exploration
- What have we not asked that we should?
- Which areas feel uncertain or fuzzy?
- Where do stakeholders disagree most?
- What questions do users, not designers, ask most often?

---

### Usage
These are **example guiding questions**, not a complete or rigid checklist:
- Use them to inspire exploration and uncover gaps.  
- Adapt, rephrase, or skip questions depending on the user’s context and responses. 
- Go beyond this list if new, relevant questions arise during the interaction.  

Goal: support open-ended discovery while keeping coverage of common blind spots.
